"title":"Michaelburgers"
"ingredients":"3 lb Ground chuck; or tad over|4 tb Water|1 tb Soy Sauce|4 ts Light Brown Sugar - heaping|2 ts Salt|2 ts Coarse ground blk pepper|2 ts Season pepper"
"servings":"1 servings"
"instructions":"Here's a recipe for burgers that has people constantly asking me to make them again... Mix all together. Form into six 1/2lb patties with burger press. Important to use a press as it creates needed density in the meat and will retain much more juice than were the patties hand formed. Using index finger, make hole in center of each burger patty. Make sure hole is similar size on other side. The hole will insure even cooking throughout the patty. Put in fridge for an hour or more. Preheat both sides of grill on high with wood on one side. Personal wood preference for these is: Pecan. Also good with many other woods, but Pecan seems to blend very well with these seasonings. When wood starts to smoke, turn that side to low, and turn off other side. Put burgers on off side of grill. Turn patties over when they release from grill..maybe 10-15 mins. Remove from grill when they look greasy (juicy) all over the tops. They will be medium well done (no pink) but squirting juice when you bite into them. Meat will be gorgeous...red cast on the outside from the smoke, like an allover exterior smoke ring . For slightly pink interior, remove when starting to show juice on outside. Cover tray of burgers with foil and let set for at least 5 minutes before serving. Know they're just burgers, but folks do rave about them. This recipe started out as Willingham's Holy Burgers. Worked with it, changed the weight, altered the ingredients, etc. Hope you like them..."
